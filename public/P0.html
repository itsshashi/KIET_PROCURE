          <h2>Acceptance - Modification</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>This Purchase Order is for the purchase of goods, services or both (collectively referred to as the "Goods") as described on the face of this document. This Purchase Order is deemed accepted when Supplier returns the acknowledgment copy of this Purchase Order or begins performing, whichever is earlier.</p>
            <p>Rittal rejects any additional or inconsistent terms and conditions offered by Supplier at any time, even if such terms are stated in the invoice or any other Supplier document. Reference to Supplier's quotation, bid or proposal does not imply acceptance of any term, condition or instruction contained therein. No course of prior dealing or usage of trade may modify, supplement or explain any terms used in this Purchase Order.</p>
            <p>No change or modification to this Purchase Order will be binding upon Rittal unless it is in writing, specifically identifies that it amends this Purchase Order and is signed by the Head of Procurement at Rittal. If Supplier becomes aware of any ambiguities, issues or discrepancies between this Purchase Order and any specification, design or other technical requirement applicable to this Purchase Order, Supplier shall immediately submit the matter to Rittal for resolution.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Delivery, Shipment and Packaging</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p><strong>2.1</strong> Supplier shall deliver the Goods in the quantities and on the date(s) specified on the Purchase Order. <strong>TIME IS THE ESSENCE OF DELIVERY.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>2.2</strong> If the delivery schedule is endangered for any reason other than Rittal's fault, Supplier shall, at its expense, deliver Goods by the most expeditious shipping method required to fulfill the Purchase Order delivery requirements. Rittal reserves the right to reject, at no expense to Rittal, all or any part of any delivery that varies from the quantity authorized by Rittal for shipment.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3</strong> Items shipped in advance of more than two days of Rittal's delivery schedule may be kept on hold by Rittal at Supplier's expense. The Purchase Order number(s) must appear on all correspondence, shipping labels and shipping documents, including packing sheets, bills of lading and air waybills. Supplier must immediately notify Rittal in writing with all relevant information relating to any delay or threatened delay in the timely performance of this PO.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Excusable Delay (Force Majeure)</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Supplier's ability to sell Goods at a more advantageous price or Supplier's economic hardship in buying materials or processing necessary for manufacture of the Goods will not constitute an excusable delay event. If delivery of any Goods is delayed for more than 14 days, Rittal may, without liability, cancel all or any part of this Purchase Order.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Delivery Terms, Title and Risk of Loss</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>When the F.O.B. point is Supplier's location, Supplier bears all risk of loss or damage to the Goods and title passes to Rittal upon delivery of the Goods by Supplier to the carrier designated or approved by Rittal. When the F.O.B. point is Rittal's location, Supplier bears all risk of loss or damage to the Goods and title passes to Rittal upon delivery of the Goods by Supplier at Rittal's designated delivery location.</p>
            <p>The foregoing does not relieve Supplier of responsibility for hidden damages discovered after acceptance of the Goods. Rittal may direct Supplier to ship the Goods to Rittal or to any third party designated by Rittal.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Import / Customs Compliance</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Supplier will be debited for any duties, fees or freight incurred by Rittal due to Supplier's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this Purchase Order.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Drawback</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Supplier shall provide Rittal with all documents, records and other supporting information necessary to obtain any duty drawback and shall extend full cooperation to Rittal for obtaining the payment.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Price</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Supplier shall furnish the Goods at the prices stated on the face of the Purchase Order. Unless otherwise provided on the face of the Purchase Order, the prices include packaging and freight to the specified delivery point; applicable taxes and other government charges including sales, use or excise taxes; and all customs duties, fees or charges.</p>
            <p>To the extent that value added tax (or any equivalent tax) is properly chargeable on the supply to Rittal of any Goods, Rittal will pay the tax as an addition to payments otherwise due Supplier under this Purchase Order, if Supplier provides to Rittal a value-added tax (or equivalent tax) invoice.</p>
            <p>Rittal reserves the right to withhold or deduct amounts if Supplier fails to provide applicable tax compliance documents. Agreed reduced pricing shall apply immediately to consignment, stocking or replenishment arrangements, undelivered Goods, open Purchase Orders and unconsumed inventory owned by Rittal.</p>
            <p>If Supplier charges a lower price to any other person/entity for similar goods, Supplier must notify Rittal and apply that price to all Goods ordered under this Purchase Order. If Rittal notifies Supplier of a lower written offer from another supplier, Supplier must immediately meet the lower price for any undelivered Goods or Rittal may terminate the balance of the Purchase Order without liability.</p>
            <p>As directed by Rittal, Supplier shall provide the Goods at the prices listed on the face of this Purchase Order to other Rittal divisions and affiliates and any third-party Rittal sub-supplier or designee.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Invoicing and Payment</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>After each shipment made or service provided, Supplier shall submit an invoice to the address indicated on the Purchase Order listing a description of the Goods, part numbers, quantity, unit of measure, hours (if applicable), and the unit and total prices. The invoice must match the corresponding Purchase Order pricing, quantities and terms, and must be sent to the invoice address listed on the Purchase Order.</p>
            <p>Itemize all applicable taxes and charges. The invoice must include (in English): (a) Supplier and Rittal entity name and address; (b) name of shipper (if different); (c) Rittal's Purchase Order number(s); (d) country of export; (e) detailed description of the Goods; (f) Harmonized Tariff Schedule number; (g) country of origin of the Goods (or origin of each part if multiple); (h) weights; (i) currency; (j) payment terms; (k) shipment terms used; and (l) all rebates or discounts.</p>
            <p>Invoices should be accompanied by a signed bill of lading or express receipt evidencing shipment. Payment of an invoice does not constitute acceptance of the Goods and is subject to appropriate adjustment if Supplier fails to meet the requirements of the Purchase Order. Payment terms are net 120 days from receipt of a Rittal-approved compliant invoice unless otherwise stated or required by applicable law.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Set Off</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Rittal may deduct any amount owing from Supplier to Rittal as a set off against any amount owing to Supplier under this Purchase Order.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Inspection</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>All Goods may be inspected and tested by Rittal, its customers and/or end users at all reasonable times and places. Supplier's standard inspection and testing system must be approved by Rittal in writing. Rittal may inspect all or a sample of Goods and may reject all or any portion of the Goods if determined defective or non-conforming within 15 days of delivery.</p>
            <p>No inspection, tests, approval, design approval or acceptance of the Goods relieves Supplier from responsibility for warranty or latent/patent defects, fraud or negligence. If Goods are defective or non-conforming, Rittal may: (a) rescind this Purchase Order as to the Goods; (b) accept the Goods at an equitable reduction in price; or (c) reject the Goods and require delivery of replacements. Replacements shall be accompanied by a written notice specifying that the Goods are replacements.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Warranty</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p><strong>11.1</strong> Supplier warrants to Rittal, its successors, assigns, customers and end users that during the entire Warranty Period specified below, all Goods supplied will: (a) be free from defects in material, workmanship and design; (b) conform to applicable drawings, designs, quality control plans, specifications and samples; (c) be merchantable; (d) be fit for the intended purposes and operate as intended; (e) comply with all laws and regulations; (f) be free and clear of liens or encumbrances; and (g) not infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Goods that fail to meet these standards are "non-conforming Goods."</p>
            <p><strong>11.2</strong> As to services, Supplier warrants that it possesses the requisite expertise, facilities and equipment to perform the services; that services will be performed in a safe and workmanlike manner; and that services will meet the highest industry standards.</p>
            <p><strong>11.3</strong> The Warranty Period is 36 months from the date of delivery to the end user or such longer period required by law. Supplier also warrants Goods to the same extent and for the same time period as warranties provided by Rittal to its customers, if longer. These warranties benefit Rittal, Rittal's customers and downstream claimants and survive delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Warranty claims do not accrue until discovery of nonconformance; any statute of limitations runs from discovery.</p>
            <p>Supplier is responsible for costs to repair, replace or correct nonconforming Goods including removal, disassembly, failure analysis, fault isolation, reinstallation, re-inspection, retrofit, freight, customer charges and corrective action costs. Any replacement Goods are warranted for the same period as the original Goods.</p>
            <p><strong>11.4</strong> In the event of a substantially similar repetitive root cause, failure mode or defect indicating a common or systemic failure ("Epidemic Failure"), the parties shall follow an agreed action plan: immediate notification, preliminary diagnosis plan within one business day, joint diagnosis and remediation, customer notification and remediation scheduling. Supplier is responsible for all costs associated with any Epidemic Failure and must immediately report any recalls, retrofits or service bulletins affecting product quality.</p>
            <p><strong>11.5</strong> No part of any software or other deliverables delivered by Supplier under this Purchase Order shall contain Open Source software without prior written approval from Rittal. If approved, Supplier must identify each Open Source item and license terms and represent compliance with applicable licenses and that Rittal's use will not adversely affect Rittal's proprietary software or require disclosure of Rittal source code or limit Rittal's commercial rights.</p>
            <p><strong>11.6</strong> Goods and Services will comply with all applicable treaties, laws and regulations of the place of manufacture and applicable Canadian, European Union and U.S. laws and standards (including TSCA, OSHA, Hazardous Communication Standard, Federal Hazardous Substances Act, California Proposition 65, RoHS, and others). Supplier shall promptly provide information and certifications evidencing compliance upon request.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Rittal may direct changes in drawings, designs, specifications, method of shipment or packing, quantity or time or place of delivery, reschedule services or require additional or diminished services. Any claim by Supplier for adjustment must be asserted in writing within 7 days from Supplier's receipt of the Rittal-directed change, including the claim amount, or the claim may be waived.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Design and Process Changes</h2>
          <div class="clause">
            <p>Supplier shall make no changes in the design, materials, manufacturing location, equipment, production process (including changes between manual and automated processes) or any other process related to the Goods without the advance written approval of Rittal's procurement head.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
