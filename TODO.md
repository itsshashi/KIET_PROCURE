# Purchase Order PDF Separation Task

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Updated file count display in table to show actual number of files
- [x] Modified `viewQuotations` function to handle `quotation_file` as an array

## Summary of Changes
- **views/Purchase.ejs**:

  - Each file now has its own preview button

## Next Steps
