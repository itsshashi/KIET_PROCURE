# Deployment Fix for Render

## Issues Identified and Fixed
- [x] Updated `render.yaml` startCommand from `npm start` to `node index.js` to match the actual main file.
- [x] Updated `package.json` start script to `node index.js`.
- [x] Updated `package.json` main entry point to `index.js`.

## Additional Recommendations
- [ ] Move environment variables from `SCR.env` to Render's Environment Variables section for security (especially EMAIL_PASS).
- [ ] Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in Render env vars if not already.
- [ ] Commit and push these changes to your repository.
- [ ] Redeploy on Render and check the logs for any remaining errors.

## Next Steps
1. Commit the changes to your git repository.
2. Push to the master branch.
3. Trigger a new deployment on Render.
4. If deployment still fails, check the Render service logs for specific error messages.
